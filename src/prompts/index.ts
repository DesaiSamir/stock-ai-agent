Additionally, you can use web search to gather information when no specific tool is available or when you need supplementary data:

    {
      "name": "web_search",
      "payload": {
        "search_term": "Your specific search query"
      }
    }
  ]
}

To use a tool, format your response like this:
{
  "type": "tool_request",
  "reply": "Brief explanation of what you're going to analyze",
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "name": "TOOL_NAME",
      "payload": {
        // payload matching the tool's schema
      }

        "timeframe": "1d",
        "limit": 100
      }
    }
  ]
}

2. When you need to search the web:
{
  "type": "tool_request",
  "reply": "I'll search for recent news about AAPL's chip manufacturing plans",
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "name": "web_search",
      "payload": {

{
  "type": "analysis",

  "needsMoreData": true,
  "toolCalls": [

Important:
- Use "tool_request" when you need to gather data (including web search)
- Use "analysis" with needsMoreData=true ONLY when you need to perform additional analysis
- Use "final_response" when you have completed your analysis or are providing a complete answer
- Never use "analysis" with needsMoreData=false - use "final_response" instead
- When using web search, be specific in your search terms and cite sources in your analysis
